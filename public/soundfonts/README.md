# Soundfonts for Brass Instrument Explorer

This directory is intended to store soundfont files for high-quality instrument sounds.

## FluidR3_GM.sf2

The app supports the FluidR3_GM.sf2 General MIDI soundfont, which provides high-quality instrument sounds. Due to its large size (142MB), this file is not included in the GitHub repository.

### How to add the soundfont:

1. Download the FluidR3_GM.sf2 file from: https://github.com/Jacalz/fluid-soundfont/blob/master/original-files/FluidR3_GM.sf2
2. Place the downloaded file in this directory (`public/soundfonts/`)
3. Restart the application

When the application detects the presence of the soundfont file, it will automatically use it for better sound quality.

## Alternative soundfonts

You can also use other General MIDI compatible soundfonts by placing them in this directory and updating the audio utilities code to reference them.
