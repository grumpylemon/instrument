# Instrument Samples

This directory is for storing instrument sound samples.

## Expected Files

For trumpet:
- trumpet-C4.mp3
- trumpet-G4.mp3
- trumpet-C5.mp3

For trombone:
- trombone-C3.mp3
- trombone-G3.mp3
- trombone-C4.mp3

Since actual sample files are not included in this repository, the app will fall back to using Tone.js synthesized sounds.

## Recommended Sources

For high-quality brass samples, consider:
1. FluidR3_GM.sf2 – A free SoundFont with quality brass sounds
2. Musyng Kite.sf2 – Good coverage of instrument ranges
3. Professional sample libraries or free samples from sites like Freesound.org

## Format

Audio files should be:
- MP3 or WAV format
- Sampled at 44.1kHz, 16-bit
- Normalized to prevent clipping
- Trimmed to start at the attack of the note
